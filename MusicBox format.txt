Song structure
=======================================
Data for each song can be found anywhere in ROM data. They are structured as follows, relative to the start of the song:

0x0000-0x00FF = Waveform data
0x0100-0x01FF = Channel 1-4 pattern list (each 0x40 (64) bytes)
0x0200-0x02FF = Instrument data
0x0300-0x03FF = Arpeggio data
0x0400-0x1FFF = Pattern data (0x38 (56 total), each 0x80 (128) bytes)

Sound effects are also stored in the data for each song as instruments.

Pattern table
=======================================
Each channel has its own individual pattern which is comprised of the following values:
00-37 = Play pattern
FE = Stop song
FF = Restart song

Pattern data
=======================================
Each pattern is 128 bytes, which is comprised of a series of 2 bytes for each row in a series of 64 rows. Each row is structured as follows:

1. Note (0 if empty)
2. Instrument (0 if empty)

DICE variant
=======================================
Two games developed by DICE (Diva Starz and JumpStart Dino Adventure) use a bizarrely modified version of this sound engine with a form of encryption.

In these games, the channel 1-4 pattern list starts at relative offset 0x0300, and the actual pattern data starts at offset 0x0700.

The values for both of these are the same, but are stored in the ROM encrypted. To decrypt the values for both of these:
 = Pattern list: Use the byte at offset 0x00E2 and XOR the value, then XOR $29 to get the final value.
 = Pattern data: Use the byte at offset 0x007A and XOR the value, then XOR $B1 to get the final value.
