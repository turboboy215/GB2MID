Song Table
=======================================
This pointer table can be found with the following instructions:

ld d, a
ld hl, [SongTable]
call ????
ld a, h
ld h, l
ld l, a
or h
ret z

Which equals the following in hex:
21 ?? ?? CD xx xx 7C 65 6F B4 C8

Song header
=======================================
A header for a song is stored as follows:

1. 1 byte flag (always 0 for music, otherwise is a sound effect)
2-3. Channel 1 pointer
4-5. Channel 2 pointer
6-7. Channel 3 pointer
8-9. Channel 4 pointer

Note that values in the song data are stored as BIG ENDIAN!

Commands
=======================================
Capcom's Game Boy sequence format is very close to the company's later NES sequence format (from 1990 onwards). Each channel's sequence is comprised of the following commands:

00 = Triplet = Connect notes to make triplets (Reduce next three notes' size to 2/3 of original)
01 = Connect = Connect note length of one or more notes (Use before first and last note)
02 xx = Dotted note = The next note becomes 1 1/2 of its original length
03 = Higher octave
04 xy = Set channel flags:
	MSB
	bit0: Connect mode flag 2. Becomes copy of bit1 when a new note has been initialized.
	bit1: Connect mode flag 1. Bit gets toggled on/off with Command 01. Cmd 04 always clears this 	bit, unless it's used to set it.
	bit2: Triplet mode flag. Bit gets toggled on/off with Command 00. Cmd 04 always clears this 	bit, unless it's used to set it.
	bit3: Dotted Note flag. Command 02 sets this bit. (Logic OR). It's cleared after the next note if set.
	bit4: Octave jump flag. Bit gets toggled on/off with command 03. Cmd 04 always clears this bit, unless it's used to set it.
	bit5-7: Octave set with Command 09. (Because it does an OR operation with the Flags memory byte, Cmd 09 can also be used to force any other of these bits on!)
	LSB
05 xx xx = Set tempo/speed
06 xx = Set note size
07 xx = Set volume (00-0F)
08 xx = Set vibrato (in NES version, set instrument)
09 xx = Set octave transpose (0A same as 00?)
0A xx = Transpose sequence (all channels) (Default: 00 - 01 to 7F)
0B xx = Transpose sequence (current channel) (Default: 00 - 01 to 7F)
0C xx = Set tuning
0D xx = Pitch slide effect
0E xx yy yy = Repeat # of times, address
0F xx yy yy = Repeat # of times, address
10 xx yy yy = Repeat # of times, address
11 xx yy yy = Repeat # of times, address
12 xx yy yy = Break to address (with flag X) - Flags are same as command 4
13 xx yy yy = Break to address (with flag X) - Flags are same as command 4
14 xx yy yy = Break to address (with flag X) - Flags are same as command 4
15 xx yy yy = Break to address (with flag X) - Flags are same as command 4
16 xx yy yy = Go to loop point
17 = End of channel track
18 xx = Set duty
19 = Set envelope?
20 = Rest (64th note)
21-3F = Play note (64th note)
40 = Rest (32th note)
41-5F = Play note (32th note)
60 = Rest (16th note)
61-7F = Play note (16th note)
80 = Rest (8th note)
81-9F = Play note (8th note)
A0 = Rest (quarter note)
A1-BF = Play note (quarter note)
C0 = Rest (half note)
C1-DF = Play note (half note)
E0 = Rest (whole note)
E1-FF = Play note (whole note)
