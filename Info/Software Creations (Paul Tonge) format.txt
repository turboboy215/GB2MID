Despite seemingly being an entirely different sound engine than the previous engine by Stephen Ruddy, it shares some commands as well as the song table format as the later version used in the Rugrats Movie.

Song table
=======================================
The song table is a series of entries containing the tempo followed by the pointer for each channel of a song. Usually, the pointer for the song table is found at offset 0x5A4C. It is structured as follows (same as The Rugrats Movie):
1. Tempo
2-3. Channel 1 pointer
4-5. Channel 2 pointer
6-7. Channel 3 pointer
8-9. Channel 4 pointer

Commands
=======================================
Commands for each channel of a song are structured as follows:
00-7F (xx (zz) yy) = Play note (X = Length if not automatic - if X is 80 or greater, then Z byte is used - subtract 80 from the first byte), Y = Size if not automatic, if 60, then is a rest)
80 xx = Repeat the following section (X = number of times)
81 = End of repeat section
82 xx (yy) = Set automatic note length (If greater than 80, then Y is used - subtract 80 from X)
83 = End of channel
84 xx xx = Go to macro
85 = Return from macro
86 xx xx = Jump to position
87 xx = "Wobble" effect
88 xx = "Distort" effect
89 xx = Set vibrato
8A xx = ?
8B xx = Set sweep
8C xx = Set panning
8D = Set panning - L
8E = Set panning - R
8F = Set panning - LR
90 = Set panning - none
91 xx = Set instrument
92 xx = Set automatic note size
93 = Set song loop point
94 = Go to song loop point
95 = Disable automatic note length
96 = Disable automatic note size
97 = Set ? to FF
98 = Set ? to 0
99 xx = ?
9A xx = ?
C0-FF = Rest
