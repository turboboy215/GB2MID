This sound engine was used in all games developed by Karma Studios; unfortunately, however, only 2 games were finished and only one of these games made it to stores.

Music in these games were supposedly converted from XM (FastTracker II) format. Music tracks are stored as "modules" which use a rather simple, although "ineffecient" structure. Each of the songs are stored at the beginning of a bank.

Song headers
=======================================
Each song begins with a "header" which is stored as follows:
1. Song length
2. Number of patterns
3. Number of instruments?
4. Speed (ticks)
5. Speed (tempo)

Following this, the pattern index is stored, which is the size of the song length specified.
After this is the instrument data, which uses the following format:
Channel identifier (2 (also used for channel 1), 3, or 4)
 - If 2, then proceeded by 2 bytes
 - If 3, then proceeded by 16 bytes (waveform)
 - If 4, then proceeded by 1 byte

Pattern data
=======================================
Patterns are always 256 bytes in length; they are 64 rows consisting of 16 bytes each, 4 for each channel in increasing order. Each channel's row data is comprised as follows:
1. Note (FF if empty)
2. Volume
3. Instrument (bits 0-3)/effect (bits 4-7) (Effect numbers appear to be the same as in XM/FT2)
4. Effect amount
