There are several variants of this sound engine, with the first being the most common version.

Song table
=======================================

Version 1
===================
In version 1, used mainly by KID, the song table consists of a series of 4 sequence numbers, one for each channel. It can be found using the following code:

add a
add a
ld hl, SongTable
ld b, $00
ld c, a
add hl, bc
ld bc, $????
ldi a, [hl]

Which equals the following in hex:
87 87 21 ?? ?? 06 00 4F 09 01 xx xx 2A

The song pointer format is as follows:
1. Channel 1 sequence
2. Channel 2 sequence
3. Channel 3 sequence
4. Channel 4 sequence

Each of the sequences referred to above refers to pointers (16-bit/2 byte) values in a table, which can be found using the code below:

ld [hl], c
add a
add a, SeqTableLow
ld e, a
ld a, $00
adc a, SeqTableHigh
ld d, a
ld l, 22
ld a, [de]
ld [hl], a
inc de
inc l
ld a, [de]

Which equals the following in hex:

71 87 C6 ?? 5F 3E 00 CE ?? 57 2E 22 1A 77 13 2C 1A

Version 2
===================
In version 2, the song table is loaded using the following code:

ld [hl], a
inc h
dec c
jr nz, ????
ld hl, SongTable
ld c, $00
ldi a, [hl]
ld b, a
ldi a, [hl]
or a
jr z, ????

Which equals the following in hex:

77 24 0D 28 21 ?? ?? 0E 00 2A 47 2A B7 28 07

The song pointer format is the same as version 1.

Version 3
===================
Version 3, used by Taito/Light Link Music, does not appear to have a consistent song table load method. However, its song pointer format is somewhat different, and supports multiple banks:

1. Bank number
2-3. Channel 1 pointer
4-5. Channel 2 pointer (big-endian)
6-7. Channel 3 pointer
8-9. Channel 4 pointer (big-endian)

Sequence commands
=======================================
Each sequence for a channel is comprised of the following commands:

00-BF xx = Play note (X = Length) (6F = Rest)
 - Note lengths are stored as follows: xxxyyyyy (X = Envelope, Y = Note length)
D0-D3 xx = Repeat section X times
D4-D7 xx xx = End of repeat section - Jump to position
D8 = Reset channel envelope attack?
D9-DB = Set channel envelope attack
DC-DF = ?
E0-E7 = Set noise
E8-EF xx = Set channel instrument parameters
F0-F3 = Set duty
F4-F5 = End of channel
F6 = Reset sweep
F7 xx = Set sweep
F8 xx = Set transpose
F9 xx = Set speed
FA xx = Set global volume
FB xx = ?
FC xx xx = Go to macro
FD xx xx = Jump to position
FE = Exit macro
FF = End of channel

Version 1 and 3 appear to have exactly the same commands. In version 2, commands D0-D7 are absent, and F4 and F5 are different, replacing the removed commands D0-D7:
F4 xx = Repeat section X times
F5 = End of repeat section
