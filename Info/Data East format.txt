Song table
=======================================
The song table is comprised of 16-bit (2-byte) pointers for songs as well as sound effects. It can be found with the following code (starts after 2 bytes):

ld hl, [SongTable]
ld c, a
ld b, $00
sla c
rl b
add hl, bc

Which equals the following in hex:
21 ?? ?? 4F 06 00 CB 21 CB 10 09

Song headers
=======================================
Each song has a "header" which is structured as follows:
1. Channel mask
2-3. ?
4-5. Channel 4 pointer
6-7. Channel 3 pointer
8-9. Channel 2 pointer
10-11. Channel 1 pointer

Sequences
=======================================
Sequences for each channel use the following commands:
00-7F = Set note length
