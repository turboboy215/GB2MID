Song table
=======================================
The song table is comprised of a series of 4 pointers specifying each individual channel of a song. These are stored as follows:

1-2. Channel 1 pointer
3-4. Channel 2 pointer
5-6. Channel 3 pointer
7-8. Channel 4 pointer

If any of these values are set to $0000, then they are not used.

Sequence commands
=======================================
In most games, commands for each channel's sequence are as follows:

00-3F = Play note with automatic length
40-7F (xx) yy = Play note with volume (If 0x80 or above, then is volume (subtract 0x80), and Y is automatic length; otherwise Y is volume)
80-BF xx = Play note with manual length (X = Manual length)
C0 xx = Set envelope
C1 xx = Set volume
C2 xx = Set transpose
C3 xx = Set tempo
C4 xx = Set duty
C5 xx xx = Go to macro
C6 = Return from macro
C7 xx yy yy = Jump to position Y, X times
C8 = (No effect)
C9 xx = ?
CA = Set bit of C9 variable
CB = Reset bit of C9 variable
CC = Reset envelope
CD = Set envelope - short
CE = Set envelope - long
CF xx = Rest
D0 xx = ?
D1 = ?
D2 xx = Set waveform length?
D3 xx = Set waveform
D4 xx = Set envelope decay?
D5 = Reset envelope decay?
D6 = Invert envelope decay?
D7 = (No effect, only functional in Ninja Boy 2?)
D8 = (No effect, only functional in Ninja Boy 2?)
D9 xx = ?
DA = ?
DB = ?
DC xx yy zz aa = Set channel parameters (Z = Transpose, A = Duty)
FF = End of channel

However, Ninja Boy, probably Culture Brain's first Game Boy game, uses a different set of commands:

(Bits 3-7)
00-1D = Play note
1E = ?
1F = Command? (use bits 0-2)

(Bits 0-2 if 1F)
00 xx = Set base note
20 xx yy zz aa = Set channel parameters (X = Volume, Y = Envelope decay type, Z = Note length table address (SLA 3 times and add to note length table), A = Duty cycle)
40 xx = Set tempo
60 xx xx = Jump to position (loop)
80 xx yy yy = Go to repeat point Y, X times
A0 = ?

FF = End of channel
