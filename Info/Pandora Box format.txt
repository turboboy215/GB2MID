Song pointers
=======================================
 - Usually begins at 0x4000 (start of bank)
 - Oni 2 uses relative pointers, while other games use absolute pointers.
 - Oni 2 and 3 both have two separate banks with different songs (Oni 2's second bank data is located in the bank before the first bank at offset $7F00)
 - Oni 5 reads its data relative from bank 0x14000 in the ROM, with its song table beginning at 0x9EBB (relative to offset 0x4000 = 0x14000) with all song pointers using a relative pointer (e.g. 0x9F08 = 0x5F08 in the current bank).

Song header format
=======================================
2x4 bytes = Track pointer (relative) = first is always 0008

Sequence commands
=======================================
00-53 xx = Play note (X = length)
54 xx = Rest (X = length)
55 xx = Drum/percussion note (type 1) (X = length)
80-D4? xx = Hold note (X = length)
D5 xx = Drum "cymbal" note (X = length)
E7 = ?
E8 = Set duty: 00
E9 = Set duty: 40
EA = Set duty: 80
EB = Set duty: C0
EC = Manually set volume: 0
ED = Manually set volume: 1
EE = Manually set volume: 2
EF = Manually set volume: 3
F0 xx = Set waveform
F1 xx = Set volume
F2 xx = Set note size
F3 xx = Set tuning
F4 xx = Set noise
F5 xx = Set tempo
F6 xx yy yy = Repeat section X times, go back Y bytes (can be used in a "nested" way)
F7 xx yy zz (aa) = Set portamento? (A is not used if X = 0)
F8 = ?
F9 xx = Set envelope
FA xx = Set waveform volume
FB = Enable sweep
FC = Disable sweep
FD = Go to the highest "nested" repeat point on final loop
FE = Reset volume?
FF xx xx = End of channel/Jump back to position

Notes:
 - Oni 4 and 5 and Mahou Kishi Rayearth 1 store their songs compressed and are decompressed in RAM. Oni 4 uses a different compression algorithm than the other 2 games.
 - Commands D5 and E7-EB are only present in Mahou Kishi Rayearth games.
